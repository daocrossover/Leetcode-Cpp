// Description:
// You are driving a vehicle that has capacity empty seats initially available for passengers.  The vehicle only drives east (ie. it cannot turn around and drive west.)
// Given a list of trips, trip[i] = [num_passengers, start_location, end_location] contains information about the i-th trip: the number of passengers that must be picked up, and the locations to pick them up and drop them off. 
// The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from your vehicle's initial location.
// Return true if and only if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips. 

// Example 1:
// Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
// Output: false

// Example 2:
// Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
// Output: true

// Example 3:
// Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,5,7]], capacity = 3
// Output: true

// Example 4:
// Input: trips = [[3,2,7],[3,7,9],[8,3,9]], capacity = 11
// Output: true

// Constraints:
// 1. trips.length <= 1000
// 2. trips[i].length == 3
// 3. 1 <= trips[i][0] <= 100
// 4. 0 <= trips[i][1] < trips[i][2] <= 1000
// 5. 1 <= capacity <= 100000

// Idea is the same as meeting room II
